# StatusList REST API

The Sphereon agent can expose a management and hosting REST API for Status Lists in W3C StatusList2021 and IETF OAuth/Token Status lists

There are 3 endpoint types (tags) of which only the `StatusList` and `StatusManagement` endpoints are important to create an integration into your solution. We provide some options
to query a status list entry by index or correlationId. This should only be used on the issuer side that manages the status lis. tOnly the /status-list/{index} endpoint is to be
used by wallets or relying parties, which need to conform to the respective statuslist and credential format specifications and thus should automatically be compatible with our
implementation

* **StatusList:**

  These endpoints are for actually managing status lists.
* **StatusManagement:**

  This endpoint is responsible for updating a status within a status-list. This can be done by index value, or by credential Id value if known.

* **StatusHosting:**

  The `/status-list/{index}` endpoint will end up in an issued credential and thus will be queried by Relying Parties and potentially wallets when inspecting the status of a
  credential.
  The other endpoints should only be used by the issuer. They allow to query based on index or correlation ids of individual entries within a statuslist. For privacy
  reasons/leakage these endpoints should not be exposed to Relying Parties.

<Note>We have [exercises](/exercises/status-list/status-list-exercises) that progressively let you use the REST API, understanding the process better in each step. You can try these after first reading this page to understand the concepts</Note>
