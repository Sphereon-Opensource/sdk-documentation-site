# Background
In today's digital landscape, ensuring the validity and trustworthiness of digital credentials (like certificates, IDs, or tokens) is more critical than ever. One of the key
challenges is keeping track of whether these credentials or tokens are active, revoked, suspended, or in any other state that affects their trust status. This is where status lists
come into play.

At its core, a status list is an indexed collection where each position in the list corresponds to a particular digital credential or token. The value at that index indicates the
status of that item—for example, whether it is active or revoked. The innovation of using an index-based approach lies in its efficiency: instead of storing individual status
records for each credential, a single, compact list can capture the state of many items.

There are two major specifications supported by our SDK. Both define how these status lists should be constructed and used:

* **W3C Status List v2021:**

  This specification is deprecated now and replaced by BitStringStatusList, which we do not support yet. It represents the status list as a Verifiable Credential Data Model (VCDM)
  1.1 credential, using a simple binary
  system (typically “0” for active and “1” for revoked or suspended) to indicate the status of each indexed credential.

* **OAuth Status List (Token Status List):**

  Targeting OAuth tokens, this specification extends the idea by allowing for more than just a binary state. It supports different bit sizes per entry, which means a token can have
  multiple statuses (such as active, suspended, revoked, or other custom states). Moreover, the OAuth status list can be represented in various formats—most notably as a JSON Web
  Token (JWT) or using Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR). It can be used with Verifiable Credentials Data Model 1.1/2.0 credentials, JWTs, SD-JWTs.

Both approaches share the common goal of efficiently and securely managing status information while also ensuring that the process of checking a credential's or token’s status
respects user privacy. A particularly interesting aspect of these systems is a concept known as herd privacy, which protects the privacy of individual status queries.

In the sections that follow, we’ll delve deeper into the details of each specification, the formats they use, how herd privacy is implemented, and the process by which relying
parties (RPs) or digital wallets check the status of a credential or token. At the end you will find an example and the links to the specifications.

# Detailed explanation of Status List Concepts

## Representations and Formats

### W3C Status List v2021

* **Representation as a VCDM 1.1 Credential:**
  The W3C Status List v2021 is issued as a Verifiable Credential, following the Verifiable Credential Datamodel 1.1. This means that the status list is not just a raw data
  structure—it is a
  cryptographically signed document that includes:
    - **Metadata:** Information about the issuer, issuance date, and other contextual details.
    - **Payload:** A binary bit array where each bit represents the status of a specific digital credential. Typically, a “0” indicates that the credential is active, while a “1”
      signals
      that it has been revoked.
    - **Linkage:** When a digital credential is issued, it includes a pointer (such as a URL along with a statusListIndex) that directs verifiers to the corresponding bit in this
      status
      list. This establishes a verifiable link between the credential and its current status.

### OAuth (Token) Status List

* Flexible Representations in JWT and CBOR:
  The OAuth Status List is designed for managing the status of tokens in the OAuth ecosystem. Unlike the binary-only approach of Status List v2021, the OAuth status list:
    * **Supports Multi-Valued Statuses:**
      Each token’s status can be represented using a number of bits sufficient to capture various states beyond simply active or revoked. For example, additional states such as
      “suspended” or “under review” can be encoded.
    * **Multiple Encoding Formats:**
        * **JWT (JSON Web Token):**
          The status list can be encapsulated as a JWT, which integrates well with existing OAuth infrastructures and supports robust cryptographic verification.
        * **CBOR (Concise Binary Object Representation):**
          Alternatively, CBOR can be used for scenarios where a compact, binary encoding is preferable—especially in environments with limited bandwidth or processing power.

## Herd Privacy: Safeguarding Query Confidentiality

A significant design feature of both the W3C Status List v2021 and the OAuth Status List is herd privacy. This concept ensures that when a party (such as a relying party or digital
wallet) checks the status of a credential or token, the privacy of query and thus the associated credential is maintained.

### How Herd Privacy Works

* **Bulk Retrieval of the Status List:**
  When an RP or wallet needs to verify a credential's status, it doesn't send a query for a specific index. Instead, it retrieves the entire status list from the hosting server.

* **Local Lookup:**
  Once the complete list is downloaded, the verifier uses the provided statusListIndex (embedded within the credential or token) to perform a local lookup. This means the status
  check happens entirely on the client side.

* **Privacy Preservation:**
  Because every verifier fetches the same complete list, the server hosting the status list never knows which particular index (or credential/token) is being checked. All queries
  look identical from the server’s perspective, effectively blending individual lookups into a “herd” of requests.

## How a Relying Party or Wallet Performs a Status Check

The process for checking the status of a credential or token is defined. Here’s a step-by-step outline of how this is typically accomplished:

1. **Reference in the Issued Credential/Token:**

   Every digital credential or token includes metadata that points to its corresponding status list:

    * A reference URL indicates where the status list can be fetched.
    * A status list index specifies the exact position within the list that holds the status information for that credential or token.
2. **Fetching the Entire Status List:**

   The RP or wallet downloads the full status list from the provided URL. This is crucial for maintaining herd privacy since it prevents the server from knowing which specific
   index
   is of interest.

3. **Local Status Lookup:**

   After downloading the list:

    * For a Status List v2021 credential, the verifier checks the bit at the specified index—interpreting “0” as active and “1” as revoked.
    * For an OAuth Status List token, the verifier examines the multi-bit value at the designated index, interpreting it according to the defined status schema (which might include
      values for suspended, active, revoked, etc.).

4. **Cryptographic Verification:**

   The integrity and authenticity of the status list are ensured by cryptographic signatures:

    * The VCDM-based status list for Status List v2021 is signed to confirm its validity.
    * JWTs or CBOR representations used in OAuth Status Lists are similarly secured through established cryptographic methods, ensuring that the data has not been tampered with.

## Linking Issued Credentials to the Status List

A fundamental aspect of both specifications is the clear, verifiable linkage between an issued credential (or token) and its corresponding status list:

* **Status List Reference in the Credential:**

  When a credential is issued, it contains a reference (often a URL) pointing to the status list that governs its revocation or status.

* **Status List Index:**

  Alongside the URL, the credential includes an index value (e.g., statusListIndex) that tells the verifier exactly where in the status list the status for this particular
  credential
  is stored.

* **Dynamic Status Management:**

  Should the status of a credential change—say, it is revoked—the issuer updates the relevant bit or multi-bit value in the status list. This dynamic linking ensures that any
  verifier checking the credential will see the current status as maintained in the central status list.

## Example of an SD-JWT Credential with an OAuthStatusList

Below is an example of an SD‑JWT (Selective Disclosure JWT) credential that incorporates an OAuthStatusList reference. In this example, the credential includes standard JWT header
and payload sections, with a dedicated field for the OAuth status list that indicates where and at what index the status of the credential can be found. (In a full SD‑JWT
implementation, additional cryptographic proofs for selective disclosure would accompany this payload.)

### In our example:

- The issuer is at `https://issuer.example.com` and the subject (credential holder) is identified by `did:example:alice`.
- The credential is an Employee Credential that includes some claims (e.g., `name` and `employeeId`).
- The `oauth_status` field contains:
    - **`status_list_credential`**: a URL pointing to an OAuthStatusList encoded as a JWT (or CBOR) that a verifier can download.
    - **`status_list_index`**: an index (here, `"42"`) indicating the position in that status list that corresponds to this credential’s status.

### JWT Header

```json
{
  "alg": "ES256",
  "typ": "JWT",
  "kid": "did:example:issuer#key-1"
}
```

**Explanation:**

- **`alg`**: Algorithm used for signing (e.g., ES256).
- **`typ`**: Type of token (JWT).
- **`kid`**: Key identifier linking to the issuer’s public key.

### JWT Payload

```json
{
  "iss": "https://issuer.example.com",
  "sub": "did:example:alice",
  "iat": 1618884473,
  "exp": 1618898073,
  "vc": {
    "@context": [
      "https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1",
      "https://www.example.com/contexts/employee.jsonld"
    ],
    "type": [
      "VerifiableCredential",
      "EmployeeCredential"
    ],
    "credentialSubject": {
      "id": "did:example:alice",
      "name": "Alice Doe",
      "employeeId": "EMP-001"
    }
  },
  "oauth_status": {
    "status_list_credential": "https://status.example.com/oauthstatuslist.jwt",
    "status_list_index": "42"
  },
  "sd_claims": {
    "credentialSubject": {
      "employeeId": {
        "nonce": "randomNonce123",
        "salt": "randomSalt456"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Explanation:**

- **`iss`, `sub`, `iat`, `exp`**: Standard JWT claims (issuer, subject, issued-at, and expiration times).
- **`vc`**: The verifiable credential payload that follows the VCDM (Verifiable Credential Data Model) structure. It includes:
    - **`@context`** and **`type`** fields to define the credential’s schema.
    - **`credentialSubject`** containing specific claims about the subject (here, Alice’s identity and employee ID).
- **`oauth_status`**:
    - **`status_list_credential`** is a pointer (typically a URL) to where the OAuthStatusList is hosted.
    - **`status_list_index`** is the specific index in that list corresponding to this credential’s status.
- **`sd_claims`**: Contains additional data used for selective disclosure (in this case, supporting the disclosure of the `employeeId` claim with associated nonce and salt values).
  The holder can later reveal these along with the original claim value.

### Selective Disclosure Proofs

In a full SD‑JWT implementation, a separate section (or an accompanying data structure) contains the cryptographic proofs required to verify selectively disclosed claims. These
proofs typically include the nonces, salts, and any additional information needed to validate the claims without revealing the entire credential.

For brevity, this example does not include the full proof set, but in practice, these would be attached (or exchanged during presentation) as additional segments alongside the
compact JWT.

### Compact SD‑JWT Format

In compact form, an SD‑JWT is typically represented as three dot‑separated Base64URL‑encoded segments:

```php-template
<BASE64URL-ENCODED-HEADER>.<BASE64URL-ENCODED-PAYLOAD>.<BASE64URL-ENCODED-SD-PROOFS>
```

For example (line breaks added for clarity):

```arduino
eyJhbGciOiJFUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCIsImtpZCI6ImRpZDpleGFtcGxlOmlzc3VlciNrZXktMSJ9.

<SD-PROOFS>
```

**Note:** In a real-world implementation, all segments would be valid Base64URL‑encoded strings, and the `<SD-PROOFS>` part would contain the actual selective disclosure proofs.

## How a Verifier Uses the OAuthStatusList

When a verifier (e.g., a wallet or RP) receives this SD‑JWT credential, it performs the following steps:

1. **Fetch the OAuthStatusList**:
    - Using the URL in `oauth_status.status_list_credential` (e.g., `https://status.example.com/oauthstatuslist.jwt`), the verifier downloads the entire status list. This bulk
      download approach ensures herd privacy—the status list host cannot tell which specific index is being queried.

2. **Lookup the Credential’s Status**:
    - The verifier then looks up the entry at index `"42"` (from `oauth_status.status_list_index`) in the downloaded status list. Depending on the schema defined by the
      OAuthStatusList, the multi-bit value at that index indicates whether the credential (or token) is active, suspended, revoked, etc.

3. **Selective Disclosure Processing**:
    - If additional claims (like `employeeId`) are required for verification, the verifier will request or process the associated selective disclosure proofs, ensuring that only
      the necessary information is revealed.

# To conclude

Status lists offer an efficient, scalable, and privacy-preserving method for managing the state of digital credentials and tokens. The W3C Status List v2021, with its simple binary
representation in a VCDM 1.1 credential, is ideal for scenarios where a clear active/revoked status is sufficient. In contrast, the OAuth Status List provides enhanced flexibility,
allowing for multiple states through variable bit sizes and supporting representations in JWT or CBOR.

Central to both models is the principle of herd privacy—by requiring that verifiers download the entire status list and perform local lookups, these systems ensure that the party
hosting the list cannot deduce which specific credential or token is being checked. This, coupled with the robust linking between credentials and their status list entries, creates
a framework that is not only secure and efficient but also respectful of user privacy.

Whether you are building systems for digital identity management, token-based authentication, or any scenario where credential validity is paramount, understanding these concepts
lays the groundwork for designing resilient, interoperable, and privacy-preserving solutions.

## 1. W3C Status List v2021

**Description:**  
The W3C Status List v2021 specification provides a method to manage the status (e.g., active, revoked) of digital credentials. It employs an index-based mechanism in which each
position in a bit array represents the state of a credential. Typically, a "0" indicates an active credential and a "1" indicates a revoked one. This status list is issued as a
Verifiable Credential using the Verifiable Credential Data Model (VCDM).

**Key Points:**

- Utilizes a binary representation (active vs. revoked).
- Integrated as a Verifiable Credential using W3C’s data model (VCDM 1.1).
- Designed for efficient revocation checking.

## 2. OAuth Status List (Token Status List)

**Description:**  
The OAuth Status List (also known as Token Status List) is designed for managing the status of OAuth tokens. Unlike the binary approach in the W3C Status List, this specification
allows for multiple status values (e.g., active, suspended, revoked) by supporting different bit sizes per entry. The OAuth status list can be represented in different encoding
formats, notably as a JSON Web Token (JWT) or using Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR).

**Key Points:**

- Supports multi-valued statuses beyond a simple binary flag.
- Can be encoded as a JWT or in CBOR for compactness.
- Useful for complex token lifecycle states.

## 3. IETF SD-JWT VC (Selective Disclosure JWT for Verifiable Credentials)

**Description:**  
SD-JWT (Selective Disclosure JWT) is an approach that allows credential holders to reveal only selected parts of their credentials. In the context of Verifiable Credentials (VCs),
SD-JWT enables selective disclosure by embedding cryptographic proofs alongside the JWT. This supports privacy-preserving presentations where only necessary claims are shared.

**Key Points:**

- Enables selective disclosure of claims in a JWT.
- Provides a way to balance privacy with verifiability.
- Currently being standardized within the IETF.

## 4. W3C Verifiable Credentials Data Model (VCDM) 1.1

**Description:**  
The W3C Verifiable Credentials Data Model (VCDM) 1.1 is the framework that defines how digital credentials are issued, presented, and verified. It provides the data structures and
protocols that underpin the creation and usage of verifiable credentials, including how status lists (like the W3C Status List v2021) are incorporated.

**Key Points:**

- Establishes a standard data model for verifiable credentials.
- Ensures interoperability among credential issuers, holders, and verifiers.
- Forms the basis for integrating status information into credentials.
