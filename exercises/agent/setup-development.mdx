title: Setup development environment
description: 'Setup a typescript development environment'
---

The exercises on the [documentation site](https://docs.sphereon.com) are using the REST APIs exposed by the agent and can be run in 3 ways. In order
of least complex to more complex:

1. Use the online demo environment
2. Install a demo agent with Docker
3. Install a demo agent from source with NodeJS

Currently, we advise to use method 1 or method 2

# 1. Using the online demo environment

We suggest to use a tool like Postman or curl, but you can also perform the exercises using the more clumsy OpenAPI tool part of
the [documentation site](https://docs.sphereon.com) or the easier online SwaggerHub which is linked with every exercise.

There is nothing you need to do additionally. You can start with the exercises straight away.

## 2. Using docker

To setup the agent with Docker, please follow the [Setup Docker](/exercises/agent/setup-docker) page

# 3. From source with NodeJS

## Checkout repository

During these examples we will be using the agent from the web-wallet project. This agent has rudimentary file configuration support, so we can easily
test and re-configure. The web wallet project is a mono-repository, meaning it has a sub-folder for the agent alone.
At a later point you could also run the full web wallet if you wish.

## Git

We need to checkout the web-wallet mono-repository repository from https://github.com/Sphereon-OpenSource/web-wallet.git

Either use your favorite Git tool or use the command line

```shell
git clone https://github.com/Sphereon-OpenSource/web-wallet.git
```

## NodeJS

Make sure to install NodeJS version 20.X

## Pnpm

To build the project [pnpm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pnpm) will be used. Do not confuse this package manager with the
more regular `npm`. Also do not use the regular `npm` for this projects.

Install pnpm version 9 globally:

```shell
npm -g install pnpm@9
```

We also need `tsx` installed globally to start the environment

```shell
npm -g install tsx
```

## Project dependencies

Go to the agent folder located in the `packages/agent` folder. You should see a package.json in that location. This is the agent module of the
web-wallet project.

Let's install the dependencies first

```shell
pnpm install
```

Now let's build the project, so that we are sure that everything is in order. During exercises this is not strictly necessary given we will start the
agent directly from the typescript files, instead of first compiling them to javascript.

```shell
pnpm build
```

## Start the agent for the first time

Let's start the agent for the first time. Since we haven't configured the agent yet, don't be surprised if the agent exists with an error message. We
just want to make sure it actually starts.

```shell
pnpm run start:dev
```

You should see console logs appearing. If the agent encounters an error, which is expected at this point, as we haven't configured it yet, it will
exit with an error.

We are now ready to [configure the agent](/exercises/agent/configure).

## Ngrok

We need to have a reverse proxy installed that terminates TLS for us. Meaning that the agent will be exposed on an https:// endpoint. This ensures
that the wallet actually will be able to access your agent, as the store versions do not allow access over an unsecured connection.

Download ngrok from the internet. Make sure it runs and listens for port 5010 locally. That is the default port the agent will use for the REST APIs.

```shell
ngrok http 5010
```

You now should see a screen like:

Make sure to copy the URL that is similar to the red underlined url. You will need it during the configuration steps
