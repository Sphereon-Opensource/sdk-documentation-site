# Credential Branding in Verifiable Credentials

Credential branding is an essential aspect of Verifiable Credentials (VCs) that helps define how a credential is displayed and identified to end-users. It plays a crucial role in creating a user-friendly and consistent experience for individuals who interact with verifiable credentials. In this explanation, we give you a detailed account of the concept of credential branding as defined in the [Verifiable Credentials Issuance (VCI) spec](https://openid.net/specs/openid-4-verifiable-credential-issuance-1_0.html) specification. It provides a framework for controlling the appearance of a credential through its metadata. This metadata enables issuers to tailor the presentation along with localized adaptations, making credentials immediately identifiable to users regardless of their language or regional preferences.

# Key Elements of OID$VC Issuer metadata Credential Branding

Credential branding in OID4VCI is implemented through several metadata parameters defined by the credential issuer or in case of SD-JWT it can be expressed in the so called VCT document. These parameters allow for comprehensive customization visual details:

- **Display Name**
A human-readable name for the credential that appears to the end user. This required element serves as the primary identifier for the credential.

- **Locale-Specific Customization**
To address the needs of users across diverse regions and languages, display properties can be localized. Each display object can include a `locale` parameter (e.g., `"en-US"`, `"es-ES"`), ensuring that not only the overall credential title but also individual claim labels and descriptions are presented in the user’s preferred language. Each locale-specific object must be unique within the array.

- **Claim Labeling**
Beyond the overall credential name, individual claims within the credential can include locale-specific display names. For instance, if the credential includes a claim such as "firstName," it can be displayed as "First Name" in English, "Nombre" in Spanish, or "Prénom" in French, in accordance with the corresponding display configuration.

- **Logos and Alternative Text**
Issuers may include a logo as part of the branding details. The logo’s JSON object typically contains:
- **URL:** The link to the hosted image. It is important that the provided URL is accessible to all parties using the credential.
- **Alt Text:** A descriptive text that serves as an alternative should the logo fail to load, ensuring accessibility.

- **Background Images and Colors**
Credential metadata supports the use of background images and custom color schemes:
- **Background Image:** A URL for a rectangular image that will be used as the background of the credential. Note that the image should be provided without rounded corners as the rendering library will manage this styling.
- **Background Color & Text Color:** CSS-compliant color values that dictate the visual theme of the credential. These parameters help ensure that the credential’s design aligns with the issuer’s branding standards.

- **Descriptions**
A brief explanation of the credential can be included in the display metadata. This description may also be localized to enhance clarity for users in different regions.

# Practical Example: Credential Branding in Action

Consider a real-world example where a conference credential is configured with comprehensive branding details. The issuer’s metadata may include a `credential_configurations_supported` object with a display array that outlines all the visual elements. For example:

```json
{
  ...
  "credential_configurations_supported": {
    "ConferenceExample": {
      ...
      "display": [
        {
          "name": "Conference Attendee",
          "description": "The DBC Conference Attendee credential is given to all visitors of the DBC conference.",
          "background_color": "#3B6F6D",
          "text_color": "#FFFFFF",
          "logo": {
            "url": "https://dutchblockchaincoalition.org/assets/images/icons/Logo-DBC.png",
            "alt_text": "An orange block shape, with the text Dutch Blockchain Coalition next to it, portraying the logo of the Dutch Blockchain Coalition."
          },
          "locale": "en_us",
          "background_image": {
            "url": "https://i.ibb.co/CHqjxrJ/dbc-card-hig-res.png",
            "alt_text": "Connected open cubes in blue with one orange cube as a background of the card"
          }
        }
      ],
      ...
    }
  },
  ...
}
```

In this example:

- The credential is identified as **"Conference Attendee"**.
- A detailed **description** provides context about the credential.
- **Background** and **text colors** are specified to align with the credential's theme.
- A **logo** is provided with both a URL and alternative text.
- A **background image** adds an additional layer of visual branding.
- The **locale** key indicates that this set of display properties is tailored for users targeting the `"en_us"` locale.

# Enhancing the User Experience

By leveraging these customizable display options, credential issuers can fine-tune the presentation of credentials to meet cultural and regional preferences. Whether through localized text, region-specific images, or custom color schemes, these details not only enhance the visual appeal but also strengthen user trust and recognition in the credential’s authenticity.
