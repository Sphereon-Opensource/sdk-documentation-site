## Presentation definition Id
For now the 1st party flow is global for all OID4VCI credentials offered, which obviously isn't flexible enough. This will be changed in the future.

In order to enable support for the 1st party flow the following change needs to be made to the `conf/oid4vci_options/your-options.json` file and the `issuerOpts` section:

```json
{
   ...
   "issuerOpts": {
      ...
      "presentationDefinitionId": "your definition id as known by the RP",
      ...

   },
   ...
}
```

Example
```json
{
   ...
   "issuerOpts": {
      ...
      "presentationDefinitionId": "PensionSdJwt",
      ...

   },
   ...
}
```

## Enable Authorization Challenge Endpoint options

In order to enable the 1st party flow, the so called authorization challenge endpoint needs to be enabled in `conf/oid4vci_options/your-options.json`:

```json
{
  "endpointOpts": {
    ...
    "authorizationChallengeOpts": {
      "enabled": true
    },
    ...
  }
}
```
