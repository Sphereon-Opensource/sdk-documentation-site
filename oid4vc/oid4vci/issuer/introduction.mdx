<Warning>
IMPORTANT the OID4VCI packages are still in an early development stage, which means that breaking changes are to be expected
</Warning>

# Background

The OID4VCI issuer is used in issuer type applications, where an organization is issuing the credential(s)

# Flows

The spec lists 2 flows. Currently only one is supported!

## Authorized Code Flow

This flow isn't supported yet!

## Pre-authorized Code Flow

The pre-authorized code flow assumes the user is using an out-of-band mechanism outside the issuance flow to
authenticate first.

The below diagram shows the steps involved in the pre-authorized code flow. Note that wallet inner functionalities (like
saving VCs) are out of scope for this library.
