# Background

A client to request and receive Verifiable Credentials using
the [OpenID for Verifiable Credential Issuance](https://openid.net/specs/openid-4-verifiable-credential-issuance-1_0.html) (
OpenID4VCI) specification for receiving Verifiable Credentials as a holder/subject.

OpenID4VCI defines an API designated as Credential Endpoint that is used to issue verifiable credentials and
corresponding OAuth 2.0 based authorization mechanisms (see [RFC6749]) that a Wallet uses to obtain authorization to
receive verifiable credentials. W3C formats as well as other Credential formats are supported. This allows existing
OAuth 2.0 deployments and OpenID Connect OPs (see [OpenID.Core]) to extend their service and become Credential Issuers.
It also allows new applications built using Verifiable Credentials to utilize OAuth 2.0 as integration and
interoperability layer. This package provides holder/wallet support to interact with OpenID4VCI capable Issuer systems.

# Flows

The spec lists 2 flows. Currently only one is supported!

## Authorized Code Flow

This flow isn't supported yet!

## Pre-authorized Code Flow

The pre-authorized code flow assumes the user is using an out-of-band mechanism outside the issuance flow to
authenticate first.

The below diagram shows the steps involved in the pre-authorized code flow. Note that wallet inner functionalities (like
saving VCs) are out of scope for this library.
