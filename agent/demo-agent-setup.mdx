## Example Demo Agent Configuration Guide

Welcome to the agent setup guide. This document will walk you through configuring your agent module by leveraging the settings defined in your `.env` file. Specifically, the
`CONF_PATH` property in your `.env` file dictates where the agent retrieves its configuration from.

Be aware that this agent configuration is for demo purposes only. The expectation is that you create the code around the agent yourself, or integrate the agent in your own
application.

The [agent code](https://github.com/Sphereon-Opensource/web-wallet/tree/feature/surf/packages/agent) being used in this README is available in the following
repository: https://github.com/Sphereon-Opensource/web-wallet

### Configuration Directory Structure

Within your `packages/agent/conf` directory, navigate to the `examples` subfolder. Here, you will find six key directories, each integral to the agent's configuration:

#### 1. dids

This directory is designated for storing Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) documents. These DID documents will be used throughout or oid4vci and oid4vp/siop process.
An example using did:jwk can be found [here](https://github.com/Sphereon-Opensource/web-wallet/blob/feature/surf/packages/agent/conf/examples/dids/jwk-es256.json)

#### 2. oid4vci_metadata

In this folder, you'll find JSON files that detail the metadata required by the [VCI specification](https://openid.net/specs/openid-4-verifiable-credential-issuance-1_0.html) and
some values that are essential for configuring this agent. Following is a table of values that should be set for a json file inside `oid4vci_metadata`:

Be aware that each file you put in this directory represents an actual exposed separate credential issuer instance.
There is a distinction between OID4VCI issuer metadata and OAuth2 Authorization server metadata files. You need both typically unless you are using an external Authorization Server.

Example OID4VCI metadata can be found [here](https://github.com/Sphereon-Opensource/web-wallet/blob/feature/surf/packages/agent/conf/examples/oid4vci_metadata/localhost.json) and OAuth2 Authorization Server metadata [here](https://github.com/Sphereon-Opensource/web-wallet/blob/feature/surf/packages/agent/conf/examples/oid4vci_metadata/localhost-auth-server.json)

#### 4. oid4vp_options

|           | `clientMetadataOpts`| Defines how the Wallet can determine Credential formats, proof types and algorithms supported by the Verifier to be used in a protocol exchange. |

#### 5. dcql_definitions

The content of this directory is essential for defining how the agent understands and processes presentation requests. This is only applied if your demo application is asking the
user for their VerifiableCredential(s) from the wallet. For an in-depth explanation of presentation_definition, refer to
the [Digital Credentials Query Language (DCQL) Documentation](https://openid.net/specs/openid-4-verifiable-presentations-1_0.html#name-digital-credentials-query-l). To understand its role in the context of
the [OID4VP specification](https://openid.net/specs/openid-4-verifiable-presentations-1_0.html), please consult the provided link.

#### 6. templates

This directory features templates designed to dynamically create Verifiable Credentials. We use [Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/) to fill the templates with data received
from the demo application. Ensure that your [form configuration](./vci-front-end.md#form-configuration)/ requested VerifiableCredential (in above section) provides the necessary
data for this process. Examples within this directory illustrate how to implement this approach. Below is one such example:

```handlebars
   {
       "@context": ["https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1"],
       "type": ["VerifiableCredential", "GuestCredential"],
       "expirationDate": "{{{ dateTimeAfterDays 7 }}}",
       "credentialSubject": {
           "firstName": "{{firstName}}",
           "lastName": "{{lastName}}",
           "email": "{{email}}",
           "type": "Sphereon Guest"
       }
   }
   ```

Each directory plays a critical role in the configuration of the agent and the successful deployment of the verifiable credential issuance ecosystem within your application. It is
essential to carefully craft the contents of these directories in alignment with your specific use cases and the standards of the decentralized identity space.

### .env variables

Your `.env.local` file should contain the following variables with values tailored to your setup:

| Variable                         | Description                                                                                                              |
