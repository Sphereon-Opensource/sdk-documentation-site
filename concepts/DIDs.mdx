# DID Introduction

## W3C specification

Decentralized identifiers are a recommended [W3C specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/).
The abstract of the [spec](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/) reads:
> Decentralized identifiers (DIDs) are a new type of identifier that enables verifiable, decentralized digital identity.
> A DID refers to any subject (e.g., a person, organization, thing, data model, abstract entity, etc.) as determined by
> the controller of the DID. In contrast to typical, federated identifiers, DIDs have been designed so that they may be
> decoupled from centralized registries, identity providers, and certificate authorities. Specifically, while other
> parties might be used to help enable the discovery of information related to a DID, the design enables the controller
> of
> a DID to prove control over it without requiring permission from any other party. DIDs are URIs that associate a DID
> subject with a DID document allowing trustable interactions associated with that subject.

So contrary to an ID being created and stored somewhere in a database of a Vendor providing a user or subject a certain
service, one of the key points is that a DID is being created and maintained by the user/subject itself. Using a DID
typically means public/private key-pairs are being used. Where the private key(s) are in control of the different
parties using DIDs.

## DID vs DID Document

A DID is an unique [URI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier), similar to an URL for a website in
your browser.

The DID Method is used to point to the actual DID specification implementation. There are currently more than 100
different implementations. See [DID method evaluation](#did-method-evaluation) for more information. The DID
Method-specific Identifier is a unique identifier for the specific DID method. The DID Method in question defines how
these method specific identifiers are being created.

A DID can be resolved to a so called DID Document. DID Documents do not contain any Personally Identifiable
Information (PII), claims or credentials. A DID contains public keys plus optional service URLs. This enables them to be
public, shareable, and portable, and provide references for further identity interaction, while preserving privacy.

**Example DID Document:**

## Cryptographic material

The [W3C spec](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/) reads:
> Each DID document can express cryptographic material, verification methods, or services, which provide a set of
> mechanisms enabling a DID controller to prove control of the DID. Services enable trusted interactions associated with
> the DID subject. A DID might provide the means to return the DID subject itself, if the DID subject is an information
> resource such as a data model.




Verifiable Credentials allow flexible methods for identifying the issuer, the subject, and holder. The identifier data
type is a URI, which can be a web page, a decentralized identifier (DID), etc. Most of the example code in the
documentation and sample implementation use DIDs.

A commonly encountered DID method during testing is [`did:key`](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-method-key/), which is a
scheme for representing offchain and offline key material as a DID based
on [the `multicodec` registry](https://github.com/multiformats/multicodec/blob/master/table.csv)),
and [`did:web`](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-method-web/), a simplified resolution mechanism for using a well-known DNS
domain as root of trust for self-publishing DID documents.

`did:key` and `did:jwk` do not support key rotation, which is sometimes a desired DID method characteristic,
especially for issuers. It also does not support so called services, which sometimes are needed.
A simple option for issuers with long-standing web domains and established processes for pushing
updates is to use `did:web`.

## DID Method Evaluation

There are a large number of DID methods, some of which are based on blockchains, some based on web pages, and some
purely generative. Some may support a complete range of DID operations like create, update, deactivate and others (like did:key) may not.

In general, DID method options will be influenced by a broader set of criteria relevant to all roles in the VC
ecosystem. A comprehensive consideration of which is available in
the [DID Method Rubric](https://w3c.github.io/did-rubric).

We Currently directly supports the following DID methods:

- web
- key
- jwk
- ebsi
