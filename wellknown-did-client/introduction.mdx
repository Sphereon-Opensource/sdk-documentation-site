### Supported actions
 * Creating a DID configuration resource.
 * Creating a domain linkage credential.
 * Verifying domain linkage based on a DID document.
 * Verifying an endpoint descriptor.
 * Verifying a DID configuration resource (option for remote possible).
 * Verifying a domain linkage credential (JWT or JSONLD).

### Requirements
#### Well-Known DID issuer
For the well-known DID issuer, an issue callback is required that does the actual issuing of the credential. This can be supplied by using a config to the issuer or as a parameter to the functions.
#### Well-Known DID verifier
For the well-known DIr verifier, a verification callback is required that does the signature verification of the credential. This can be supplied by using a config to the issuer or as a parameter to the functions.
