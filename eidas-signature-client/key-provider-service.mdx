title: 'Key Provider Service'
---

The Key Provider Service allows to manage public/private keys and Certificates using either a PKCS#12 keystore file as byte array or filepath.
It also
has support for PKCS#11 hardware (HSM and USB cards) as well as support for a Remote REST Key Provider and a Azure Keyvault/Managed HSM
Key Provider. Next to certificate/key management a Key Provider also is responsible for creating and verifying signatures themselves.
Other operations, like creating a hash, merging a signature into an input document are handled by a Signature Service instead of the Key
Provider. A Single Key Provider can be shared by different Signature Services, as explained [above](/eidas-signature-client/introduction#signature-flow)

Given the wide range of supported import/creation methods, this library does not create or
import keys/certificates. The REST API does have support for it. Please use your method of choice (
see [below](#use-existing-tooling-to-create-a-certificate-and-keystore) for some pointers).

## PKCS\#12 Keystore Key Provider Service

The below example in Kotlin sets up a Key Provider Service using a PKCS#12 keystore file at a certain path

````kotlin kotlin
val providerPath = "path/to/pkcs12.p12"
val passwordInputCallback = PasswordInputCallback(password = "password".toCharArray())
val providerConfig = KeyProviderConfig(
    type = KeyProviderType.PKCS12,
    pkcs12Parameters = KeystoreParameters(providerPath)
)
val keyProvider = KeyProviderService(
    KeyProviderSettings(
        id = "my-pkcs12-provider",
        providerConfig,
        passwordInputCallback
    )
)
````

### Use existing tooling to create a certificate and PKCS\#12 keystore

How to generate and/or import X.509 certificates and PKCS#12 keystores is out of scope of this project, but we provide some hints below. There are
numerous resources on the internet to create X.509 certificates and PKCS#12 keystores.

#### Creating a PKCS\#12 keystore using OpenSSL

The private key and certificate must be in Privacy Enhanced Mail (PEM) format (for example, base64-encoded
with ``----BEGIN CERTIFICATE---- and ----END CERTIFICATE----`` headers and footers).

Use the following OpenSSL commands to create a PKCS#12 file from your private key and certificate. If you have one certificate, use the CA root
certificate.

````
openssl pkcs12 -export -in <signed_cert_filename> -inkey <private_key_filename> -name ‘tomcat’ -out keystore.p12
````

If you have a chain of certificates, combine the certificates into a single file and use it for the input file, as shown below. The order of
certificates must be from server certificate to the CA root certificate.

See RFC 2246 section 7.4.2 for more information about this order.

````
cat <signed_cert_filename> <intermediate.cert> [<intermediate2.cert>] > cert-chain.txt
openssl pkcs12 -export -in cert-chain.txt -inkey <private_key_filename> -name ‘tomcat’ -out keystore.p12
````

When prompted, provide a password for the new keystore.

## PKCS\#11 Hardware Security Module and Card based Key Provider Service

The PKCS#11 Key Provider allows you to use Hardware Security Based solutions that can interact using a PKCS#11 interface. It needs access to
the driver library in order to operate.

````kotlin kotlin
val passwordInputCallback = PasswordInputCallback(password = "password".toCharArray())
val providerConfig = KeyProviderConfig(
    type = KeyProviderType.PKCS11,
    pkcs11Parameters = Pkcs11Parameters(
        pkcs11LibraryPath = "/usr/lib/opensc-pkcs11.so", // The PKCS11 driver path
        slotId = 0,
        slotListIndex = 2
    )
)
val keyProvider = KeyProviderService(
    KeyProviderSettings(
        id = "my-pkcs11-provider",
        providerConfig,
        passwordInputCallback
    )
)
````

````kotlin kotlin
class Pkcs11Parameters(
    /** The path to the library  */
    val pkcs11LibraryPath: String? = null,

    /** The callback to enter a password/pincode  */
    val callback: PasswordInputCallback? = null,

    /** The slot Id to use  */
    val slotId: Int? = 0,

    /** The slot list index to use  */
    val slotListIndex: Int? = -1,

    /** Additional PKCS11 config  */
    val extraPkcs11Config: String? = null
)

````

## Azure Keyvault or Managed HSM Key Provider Service

An Azure Keyvault Key Provider uses Azure Keyvault and Azure Managed HSM to retrieve certificates, create the Signature and verify a
signature.
The below example in Kotlin sets up a Key Provider Service using Azure Keyvault or Azure Managed HSM. Both Keyvault and Managed HSM support Hardware
Security Modules. The Managed HSM service is Microsoft's solution for an HSM not shared with other customers/tenants.

**Note:** _Although the Azure Key Provider should work with Azure Managed HSM, the library is not being tested against Azure Managed HSM, as
opposed to Azure Keyvault._

````kotlin kotlin
val providerConfig = KeyProviderConfig(
    type = KeyProviderType.AZURE_KEYVAULT
)
val keyvaultConfig = AzureKeyvaultClientConfig(
    keyvaultUrl = "https://your-keyvault-here.vault.azure.net/",
    tenantId = "<your-directory-id-as-shown-in-keyvault-properties>",
    credentialOpts = CredentialOpts(
        credentialMode = CredentialMode.SERVICE_CLIENT_SECRET, // Use a client id and secret to authenticate as an app
        secretCredentialOpts = SecretCredentialOpts(
            clientId = "<client id which has access to keyvault>",
            clientSecret = "<client secret belonging to client id>"
        )
    ),
    hsmType = HSMType.KEYVAULT, // Either KEYVAULT as HSM (FIPS140 Level-2), or MANAGED_HSM
    applicationId = "your-application-id-or-name", // This can be randomly choosen
    exponentialBackoffRetryOpts = ExponentialBackoffRetryOpts(
        maxTries = 10, // let's try max 10 times
        baseDelayInMS = 500, // Wait 0,5 seconds the first time
        maxDelayInMS = 15000 // Wait for max 15 seconds eventually
    )
)

val providerSettings = KeyProviderSettings(
    id = "my-keyvault-provider",
    providerConfig
)

// From a factory
var keyProvider = KeyProviderServiceFactory.createFromConfig(settings = providerSettings, azureKeyvaultClientConfig = keyvaultConfig)


// Or directly:
keyProvider = AzureKeyvaultKeyProviderService(providerSettings, keyvaultConfig)
````

## REST Key Provider

The REST Key Provider uses REST to get Keys/Certificates It also exposes the createSignature and verifySignature methods as REST endpoints.
Lastly other methods like creating a digest, determineSignInput and placing the signature in the original document could also be executed remotely if
desired. This is however handled by the RESTClientSignatureService.

### Authentication and Authorization support

The REST Key Provider has OAuth2, OpenID Connect and bearer token support integrated.

#### OAuth2 support

The REST Key Provider client has support for oAuth2 and by extension OpenID Connect. Access to the OAuth2 functionality can be
achieved by
invoking the `oauth()` method on the REST Key Provider after providing the appropriate configuration:

````kotlin kotlin
val keyProviderSettings = KeyProviderSettings(
    id = "rest-oauth2",
    config = KeyProviderConfig(
        cacheEnabled = true,
        type = KeyProviderType.REST,
    )
)
val restConfig = RestClientConfig(
    baseUrl = "https://example.rest.service/signature/1.0",
    oauth2 = OAuth2Config(
        tokenUrl = "https://example.auth-server.com/auth/realms/sign-test/protocol/openid-connect/token",
        flow = OAuthFlow.APPLICATION,       // Use a clientId/clientSecret
        scope = "sign:vdx_sign_cert",       // Request scope, see scope chapter below
        clientId = "<client-id>",           // Provided by the IDP administrator
        clientSecret = "<client-secret>",   // Provided by the IDP administrator
        accessToken = "ey...."              // Typicaly should not be included. Can be used instead of clientId/secret when a static token is being used for instance
    )
)

val restKeyProvider = RestClientKeyProviderService(keyProviderSettings, restConfig)
// Use the respective methods to get certificate or sign at this point. It will use oAuth2 to request a token and refresh tokens

// If oauth2 access is needed the oauth() method can be used. For instance to renew the access token
restKeyProvider.oauth().renewAccessToken()

// From this point on requests will use the new token
````

#### Bearer Token and JWT support

The REST Key Provider client has support to include bearer tokens (JWTs) in the authentication header. Access to the JWT functionality can be
achieved by
invoking the bearerAuth() method on the REST Key Provider after providing the appropriate configuration:

````kotlin kotlin
val keyProviderSettings = KeyProviderSettings(
    id = "rest-bearer",
    config = KeyProviderConfig(
        cacheEnabled = true,
        type = KeyProviderType.REST,
    )
)
val restConfig = RestClientConfig(
    baseUrl = "https://example.rest.service/signature/1.0",
    bearerAuth = BearerTokenConfig(
        schema = "bearer", // Can be omitted as it is the default
        bearerToken = "ey.....ffd" // Usefull to set an initial token or when the token is static
    )
)

val restKeyProvider = RestClientKeyProviderService(keyProviderSettings, restConfig)
// Use the respective methods to get certificate or sign at this point. It will use the bearer token in every request

// If the bearer token needs to be updated
restKeyProvider.bearerAuth().bearerToken = "ey.....<updated.bearer.token>..."

// From this point on requests will use the new token
````

#### OAuth2, OpenID Scopes

The REST Microservice can be configured to support scopes. It is supported for both OAuth2 and OpenID Connect. Scopes are optional and when enabled,
protect the API endpoints from users not having access to a certain scope at an endpoint level.

The available scopes are:

- **read:vdx_sign_key**:    Read/List keys
- **admin:vdx_sign_key**:   Administer keys
- **sign:vdx_sign_key**:    Sign using keys
- **read:vdx_sign_config**:  Read configurations
- **admin:vdx_sign_config**: Create and update configurations

Please note that this doesn't provide protection at an individual configuration nor key level. For these there is role support. The eIDAS REST
MS documentation provides more info on this subject.

To enable scopes, you have to use your IAM solution of choice which supports oAuth2 or OpenID Connect and ensure that the appropriate scopes are
requested from the IAM solution. How this works is different per IAM and outside the scope of this README.

The REST Key Provider can set the scopes before requesting the tokens using the configuration as shown [above](#oauth2-support). You can also
programmatically set the scopes:

````kotlin kotlin
restKeyProvider.oauth().setScope("sign:vdx_sign_cert")
````

#### Roles support

The REST Microservice has role based support. It is possible to define roles on individual configurations as well as individual keys. Meaning
you can define which roles and thus users/groups can access and administer certain signing configurations, as well as which users/groups can sign
using a particular key. This is more fine-grained than using the scopes above. Of course both could be used together if desired. The use of
roles is explained in the Micro Service documentation. How roles should be made available to the JWT/bearer tokens is outside the scope of this
README.

## Key Provider caching

Especially for remote Key Providers like the REST, Azure and PKCS#11 Key Providers it might make sense to enable Key/Certificate
caching. This means that a key which has been retrieved recently and which has not hit the configured Time to Live yet, will be returned from the
local cache, improving performance. Please be aware that this library is not involved in updating or replacing keys as these are highly implementation
specific. As such providing a really high TTL could return a stale Key/Certificate if the Key had been replaced for a certain kid value. Given
keys/certificates are not replaced that often in practice this shouldn't be too much of a problem. Please note that the actual signing using a
key/certificate is rarely done using a cached key/certificate itself, given the private key is seldomly included. The `createSignature` method
typically isn't involved in the caching mechanism.

````kotlin kotlin
CertProviderConfig(
    cacheEnabled = true, // Enable caching of keys/certificates. Requires a JSR107 Cache implementation on the classpath! */
    cacheTTLInSeconds = 600, // How long in seconds should keys be kept in the cache since last access. Default: 5 min
)
````

## List keys, certificates

To list all available keys of the provider one can use the getKeys() method. A list of IKeyEntry objects is being returned. The interface does
not expose private keys, as developers typically should not access the private key directly and not every supported implementation gives access to
private keys. If you are sure that key contains private keys, you can cas the result to IPrivateKeyEntry.

````kotlin kotlin
val keys = keyProvider.getKeys()
println(Json { prettyPrint = true; serializersModule = serializers }.encodeToString(keys))
````

````json json
[
  {
    "type": "PrivateKeyEntry",
    "kid": "test-key",
    "privateKey": {
      "algorithm": "RSA",
      "value": "MIIJRAIBAD....lpe53o2VXP",
      "format": "PKCS#8"
    },
    "encryptionAlgorithm": "RSA",
    "certificate": {
      "value": "MIIE...ybsgEkgc="
    },
    "certificateChain": [
      {
        "value": "MIIE...ybsgEkgc="
      }
    ]
  }
]
````

## Get a key/certificate by kid

Use the geKey(kid: String) method to get a single key IKeyEntry object by kid if it exists. If it does not exist null is being returned.
The IKeyEntry interface does not expose private keys, as developers typically should not access the private key directly and not every supported
implementation gives access to private keys. If you are sure that the key entry contains private keys, you can cast the result to IPrivateKeyEntry.
Make sure to
never sent private keys across unprotected network connections!

````kotlin kotlin
val key = keyProvider.getKey("test-key")
println(Json { prettyPrint = true; serializersModule = serializers }.encodeToString(key))
````

````json json
  {
  "type": "PrivateKeyEntry",
  "kid": "test-key",
  "privateKey": {
    "algorithm": "RSA",
    "value": "MIIJRAIBAD....lpe53o2VXP",
    "format": "PKCS#8"
  },
  "encryptionAlgorithm": "RSA",
  "certificate": {
    "value": "MIIE...ybsgEkgc="
  },
  "certificateChain": [
    {
      "value": "MIIE...ybsgEkgc="
    }
  ]
}
````

## Create the signature

Depending on the Key Provider this method could be traversing the network as it might call a signature REST API, or use a
network/cloud based Hardware Security Module containing the private key to sign. As such we advise to create the digest hash using a SignatureService
beforehand so original
documents/data is not being sent. Only the hash digest will traverse the network.

````kotlin kotlin
val signature = keyProvider.createSignature(digestInput, keyEntry)
println(Json { prettyPrint = true; serializersModule = serializers }.encodeToString(signature))
````

````json json
{
  // The actual signature
  "value": "SoSsp+Mut3....XEDqEVw==",
  "algorithm": "RSA_SHA256",
  "signMode": "DIGEST",
  // The certificate used during signing
  "certificate": {
    "value": "MIID1D....6Q42vNaS"
  },
  // The certificate chain including the Certificate Authority (CA) last
  "certificateChain": [
    {
      "value": "MIID1D....6Q42vNaS"
    },
    {
      "value": "MIID6j....GePoU8Ug=="
    },
    {
      "value": "MIIDVzC....PSNfsSBog=="
    }
  ]
}
````
