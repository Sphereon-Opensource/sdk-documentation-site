## Initialize the Signature Service

The Signature service wants to have a Key Provider as single argument. If you want to use multiple Key Providers you will have to
instantiate multiple signature services.

````kotlin kotlin
val signingService = SignatureService(keyProvider = keyProvider)
````

## Determine Sign Input

Determines the bytes that will serve as input for the `digest` or `createSignature` methods.
Since multiple signature types are supported the configuration and key are required te determine the appropriate mode of extraction. For instance
Pades signatures do not need a simple digest of the full file contents, depending on whether the PDF document already contains signatures. This method
should be called first when creating a signature.

````kotlin kotlin
val padesConfig = SignatureConfiguration(
    signatureParameters = SignatureParameters(
        // Make sure the signature becomes part of the file
        signaturePackaging = SignaturePackaging.ENVELOPED,
        // Use RSA and SHA256
        digestAlgorithm = DigestAlg.SHA256,
        encryptionAlgorithm = CryptoAlg.RSA,
        signatureLevelParameters = SignatureLevelParameters(
            // Set the level to PAdES baseline B
            signatureLevel = SignatureLevel.PAdES_BASELINE_B,
        ),
        signatureFormParameters = SignatureFormParameters(
            // PAdES specific parameters
            padesSignatureFormParameters = PadesSignatureFormParameters(
                signerName = "John Doe",
                contactInfo = "support@sphereon.com",
                reason = "Test",
                location = "Online"
            )
        )
    )
)

val pdfDoc = File("input.pdf")
val origData = OrigData(value = pdfDocInput.readBytes(), name = pdfDoc.name)
val keyEntry = signingService.keyProvider.getKey("test-key")!!

val signInput = signingService.determineSignInput(
    origData = origData,
    keyEntry = keyEntry,
    signMode = SignMode.DOCUMENT,
    signatureConfiguration = signatureConfiguration
)
println(Json { prettyPrint = true; serializersModule = serializers }.encodeToString(signInput))
````

The below SignInput object could be used directly for the createSignature method or a digest can be created first, so that the input data will never
traverse a network if a remote Sign REST API or remote Hardware Security Module is being used.

````json json
{
  "input": "MYHeMBgGCSqG....TAkxVAgEK",
  "signMode": "DOCUMENT",
  "digestAlgorithm": "SHA256",
  "name": "input.pdf"
}
````

## Create a hash digest for additional privacy and security

The `digest` method creates a hash digest out of the SignInput. The hash digest is a one way function that creates the fingerprint of the file. From
the digest you cannot get back to the original input data/document. This means any Personally Identifiable Data or Data which needs to stay private
will not be available to methods which need access to a remote REST API or remote Hardware Security Module. This obviously is preferable from a
privacy and security perspective. It allows users of the library to execute all methods on premise and then depending on the chosen Key
Provider sign the data either on premise or remotely. In no circumstance will the input data leave the premise.

````kotlin kotlin
val digestInput = signingService.digest(signInput)
println(Json { prettyPrint = true; serializersModule = serializers }.encodeToString(digestInput))
````

Notice that the below SignInput object is different from the passed in SignInput. The input value is shorter as it now is a hash digest. The signMode
moved from `DOCUMENT` to `DIGEST` so that the `createSignature` method knows not to create a hash digest out of the input anymore.

````json json
{
  "input": "fSx6BzHxJ8p3Mn9E52DJ1eNrchfcMa1ZHaSjAi9D5z8=",
  "signMode": "DIGEST",
  "digestAlgorithm": "SHA256",
  "name": "input.pdf"
}
````

## Create the signature

The default Signature Service implementations delegate this method to the corresponding method of the KeyProvider, given most
KeyProviders to not expose private keys for security reasons.

Depending on the Key Provider settings this method could be traversing the network as it might call a signature REST API, or use a
network/cloud based Hardware Security Module containing the private key to sign. As such we advise to create the digest beforehand so original
documents/data is not being sent. Only the hash digest will traverse the network.

````kotlin kotlin
val signature = signingService.createSignature(digestInput, keyEntry)
println(Json { prettyPrint = true; serializersModule = serializers }.encodeToString(signature))
````

````json json
{
  // The actual signature
  "value": "SoSsp+Mut3....XEDqEVw==",
  "algorithm": "RSA_SHA256",
  "signMode": "DIGEST",
  // The certificate used during signing
  "certificate": {
    "value": "MIID1D....6Q42vNaS"
  },
  // The certificate chain including the Certificate Authority (CA) last
  "certificateChain": [
    {
      "value": "MIID1D....6Q42vNaS"
    },
    {
      "value": "MIID6j....GePoU8Ug=="
    },
    {
      "value": "MIIDVzC....PSNfsSBog=="
    }
  ]
}
````

## Signing the original data, merging the signature

This method takes the original input document, the created signature and merges them together to provide a signed output document. It needs access to
the configuration to know how and where the signature should be merged with the document.

````kotlin kotlin
val signOutput = signingService.sign(origData, signature, signatureConfiguration)

// Write the signed bytes to a file
File("signed-output.pdf").writeBytes(signOutput.value)

println(Json { prettyPrint = true; serializersModule = serializers }.encodeToString(signOutput))
````

The result of the above is a new file which is the input PDF, but now signed.

````json json
{
  // The signed data/document
  "value": "JVBERi0xLjYNJ....4cmVmCjc2NzUwCiUlRU9GCg==",
  "signMode": "DIGEST",
  "digestAlgorithm": "SHA256",
  "name": "input-pades-baseline-b.pdf",
  "mimeType": "application/pdf",
  "signature": {
    "value": "SoSsp+Mut3....XEDqEVw==",
    "algorithm": "RSA_SHA256",
    "signMode": "DIGEST",
    "certificate": {
      "value": "MIID1DCC....XxY1e6Q42vNaS"
    },
    "certificateChain": [
      {
        "value": "MIID1DCC....XxY1e6Q42vNaS"
      },
      {
        "value": "MIID6jCC....Y+TpJGePoU8Ug=="
      },
      {
        "value": "MIIDVzCCAj....PSNfsSBog=="
      }
    ]
  }
}
````
## simpleSign an original data
This method takes the original input document, and applies the following methods:

First  `determineSignInput` is called, resulting in a `SignInput` object being passed to the `digest` method. Then the `siganture` is being created using `createSignature` with the digest result and last the sign method is using the original data together with the signature. The `SignOutput` containing the signed document as well as signature information is being returned.
````kotlin kotlin
val signOutput = signingService.simpleSign(origData, keyEntry, SignMode.DOCUMENT, signatureConfiguration)
````
The result of the above is a `SignOutput` which is the original input, but now signed.

````json json
{
  // The signed data/document
  "value": "JVBERi0xLjYNJ....4cmVmCjc2NzUwCiUlRU9GCg==",
  "signMode": "DIGEST",
  "digestAlgorithm": "SHA256",
  "name": "input-pades-baseline-b.pdf",
  "mimeType": "application/pdf",
  "signature": {
    "value": "SoSsp+Mut3....XEDqEVw==",
    "algorithm": "RSA_SHA256",
    "signMode": "DIGEST",
    "certificate": {
      "value": "MIID1DCC....XxY1e6Q42vNaS"
    },
    "certificateChain": [
      {
        "value": "MIID1DCC....XxY1e6Q42vNaS"
      },
      {
        "value": "MIID6jCC....Y+TpJGePoU8Ug=="
      },
      {
        "value": "MIIDVzCCAj....PSNfsSBog=="
      }
    ]}
}
````

## Check whether a signature is valid

The default Signature Service implementations delegate this method to the corresponding method of the KeyProvider.

In order to check whether a signature is valid the SignInput is needed. If a reference to that data is not available anymore the `determineSignInput`
and depending on whether a hash digest was create the `digest` method are needed to get back the SignInput object.

````kotlin kotlin
val valid = signingService.isValidSignature(digestInput, signature, signature.certificate!!)
// Returns a boolean
````
