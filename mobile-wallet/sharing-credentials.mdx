title: 'Sharing Credentials with a Verifier'
---


You can share Verifiable Credentials with so called Verifiers or Relying Parties. The wallet has support for multiple open standards to share
these Credentials. Currently on the OpenID for Verifiable Presentations standard is enabled.

## OpenID for Verifiable Presentations (OID4VP) process

The current wallet supports the new OID4VP specification for sharing credentials. To share a credential from the wallet with the Verifier,
using [OpenID for Verifiable Presentations (OID4VP)](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-4-verifiable-presentations-1_0-ID1.html)
the following steps can be followed.
Please note that the Verifiable Credentials shared with the below list should only be used for
demo/testing purposes.

1. Launch the wallet
2. Navigate to the QR reader at the bottom left.
3. Scan one of the QR codes of the following verifiers:

   - [Sphereon](https://ssi.sphereon.com/demo/verifier/) (needs the branded Sphereon credential from the Sphereon issuer)
   - [Dutch Blockchain Coalition](https://dutchblockchaincoalition.org/en/userlogin) (Use the login button/screen. It needs the branded DBC credential from the Dutch Blockchain Coalition issuer)
   - [Future Mobility Data Marketplace](https://marketplace.future-mobility-alliance.org/) (Use the login button top-right. It needs the branded FMDM credential from the Future Mobility Alliance issuer)
   - [Auth0](https://verifiablecredentials.dev/presentation) (change the uri: `"uri": "<CREDENTIAL_TYPE>"` to `"uri": "SphereonWalletIdentityCredential"`)

4. The first time you encounter an Issuer or Verifier system a Contact needs to be created. The Wallet will pre-fill a
   suggest name:

5. Please note that you have to press the Accept button and make sure the checkbox is enabled

6. You will now go to the overview screen from where you will have to select the required Verifiable Credentials from your wallet. An error will be displayed if the Verifier is asking information not present in your wallet

7. You need to click on the list items in the screen showing "Select a credential". The texts in these list items come from the Verifier and should provide you with hints on why the information is needed.
8. After you click on a single list-item for a specific input requirement, you will go to the overview screen of available Verifiable Credentials that can satisfy this requirement:

9. On the available credentials screen you can directly touch/select the Credential using the image or checkbox. Or you can click on the text next to it, to actually view the details of the Credential:

10. No matter what step you followed, you will now see 1 credential selected (the current wallet only supports 1 credential per input requirement, but does support multiple input requirements from a Verifier)

11. The share button should now be enabled and you should see a green checkmark next to the input requirement. Click on Share:

12. The credential has now been successfully shared with the Verifier. Typically the Verifier system will show you some message or change it's screen
