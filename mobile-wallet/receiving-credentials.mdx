title: 'Receiving Credentials from an Issuer'
---


You can receive Verifiable Credential from so called issuers. The wallet has support for multiple open standards to get
these Credentials. Currently on the OpenID for Verifiable Credential Issuance standard is enabled.

## OpenID for Verifiable Credential Issuance (OID4VCI) process

The current wallet only supports the new OID4VCI specification for receipt of credentials. To get a credential issued to
the wallet,
using [OpenID for Verifiable Credential Issuance (OpenID4VCI)](https://openid.net/specs/openid-4-verifiable-credential-issuance-1_0.html)
the following steps can be followed.
The below issuer systems were part of the [JFF/W3C-EDU plugfest 2](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/vc-ed/plugfest-2-2022/) to
show interop for OpenID4VCI. Please note that the Verifiable Credentials issued by the below list are just for
demo/testing purposes.

1. Launch the wallet
2. Navigate to the QR reader at the bottom left.
3. Scan one of the QR codes of the following issuers:

5. Please note that you have to press the Accept button and make sure the checkbox is enabled

6. Depending on whether the issuer supports issuing multiple credentials or not, you will have to make a selection. Note
   that the current wallet can only accept one credential at a time!

7. Depending on whether the issuer is requiring a Pincode you will have to enter a pincode. Note this is not the pincode
   of your wallet!:
