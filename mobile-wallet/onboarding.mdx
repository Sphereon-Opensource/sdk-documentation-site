title: 'Onboarding'

Since the Wallet is a so-called Self Sovereign Identity Wallet, no information you provide during the onboarding will be
shared with any external. That includes the developer (Sphereon) of the Wallet. You will always be asked when receiving
or sharing data with external systems. The user details you provide during the onboarding are used for personalization,
supporting multiple profiles and future features of the Wallet. There is no e-mail validation or external system
involved.

## The onboarding process

**Step 1**. Launch the Sphereon Wallet

**Step 2.** Once you start the Sphereon Wallet the first time you will be greeted by the Welcome screen:
