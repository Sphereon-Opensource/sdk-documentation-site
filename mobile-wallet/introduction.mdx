# Sphereon Wallet

The Sphereon Wallet is a new breed of open standards, open-source, privacy-preserving applications, that gives you full
and sole control over your own information. It enables you to manage your own data.


## Introduction

Your data is stored nowhere else but on your phone. Nobody else will have access unless you decide to share it with
them. Only you decide if you want to share your data with someone else.

The Sphereon Wallet is build around [W3C Decentralized Identifiers](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/) and can
receive [W3C Verifiable Credentials](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/) from Issuers and present them to Verifiers.

The wallet is build using our Apache2 open-source licensed [SSI-SDK](https://github.com/Sphereon-Opensource/ssi-sdk) and
its [key/DID extensions](https://github.com/Sphereon-Opensource/SSI-SDK-crypto-extensions), which you can use to create
Issuer and Verifier agents as well as mobile and web wallets.
