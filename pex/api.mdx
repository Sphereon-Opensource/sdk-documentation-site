### Evaluate

```typescript
PEX.evaluatePresentation(presentationDefinition, verifiablePresentation);
PEXv1.evaluatePresentation(presentationDefinition, verifiablePresentation);
PEXv2.evaluatePresentation(presentationDefinition, verifiablePresentation);
```

##### Description

These three methods are quite similar. The first One receives a presentation definition object, decides the version
based upon feature detection and acts accordingly. The other two are specific to their Presentation Exchange definition
version.

**For more detailed difference between v1 and v2 please read the [From V1 to V2 section](#from-v1-to-v2)**.

Evaluates whether a presentation submission meets the requested presentation definition Since this method will be used
both **before** and **after** creating a VerifiablePresentation, we accept both _signed_ and _unsigned_ version of a
presentation here.

#### Parameters

| name                     | type                     | description                                                                                                                                    |
|--------------------------|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `presentationDefinition` | `PresentationDefinition` | the presentation definition that initiated the request from the verifier                                                                       |
| `presentation`           | `IPresentation`          | the Presentation object containing the required credentials and a `presentation_submission` object mapping back to the presentation definition |

#### Return value

If evaluation is successful, `value` will be a non-null `PresentationSubmission` mapping the submitted credentials to
the requested inputs.

```typescript
interface EvaluationResults {
  value?: PresentationSubmission;
  warnings?: string[];
  errors?: Error[];
  verifiableCredential: (IVerifiableCredential | JwtWrappedVerifiableCredential | string)[];
}
```

### SelectFrom

```typescript
PEX.selectFrom(presentationDefinition, credentials, { holderDIDs });
PEXv1.selectFrom(presentationDefinitionV1, credentials, { holderDIDs });
PEXv2.selectFrom(presentationDefinitionV2, credentials, { holderDIDs });
```

##### Description

These three methods are quite similar. The first One receives a presentation definition object, decides the version
based upon feature detection and acts accordingly. The other two are specific to their version.

**For more detailed difference between v1 and v2 of the spec please read the [From V1 to V2 section](#from-v1-to-v2)**.

Gathers the matching credentials that fit a given presentation definition. Please note that there could be multiple
results fitting the same criteria. This basically only filters out the credentials that do not match the definition.
You, or rather the user, typically has to do a final selection.

#### selectFrom Parameters

| name                     | type                                                                    | description                                                                                                                                                  |

#### Return value

- If the selection was successful or partially successful, the `matches` array will consist
  of `SubmissionRequirementMatch` object(s), representing the matching credentials for each `SubmissionRequirement` in
  the `presentationDefinition` input parameter.
- If the selection was not successful, the `errors` array will consist of `Checked` object(s), representing what has
  failed in your selection process.

```typescript
import { Status } from './ConstraintUtils';

interface SelectResults {
  errors?: Checked[];
  matches?: SubmissionRequirementMatch[];
  /**
   * This is the parameter that the PEX library user should look into to determine what to do next
   * Status can have three values:
   *  1. INFO: everything is fine, you can call `presentationFrom` after this method
   *  2. WARN: method was called with more credentials than required.
   *       To enhance credential holderDID's privacy it is recommended to select credentials which are absolutely required.
   *  3. Error: the credentials you've sent didn't satisfy the requirement defined presentationDefinition object. Do not submit!

PEXv1.presentationFrom(presentationDefinitionV1, selectedCredentials, { holderDID });
PEXv2.presentationFrom(presentationDefinitionV2, selectedCredentials, { holderDID });

### Validation

```

```typescript
validateSubmission(objToValidate);
```

#### Description

A validation utility function for `PresentationDefinition` and `PresentationSubmission` objects. If you know the version
of your presentation definition you can call version-specific functions. If not you can call the general one (located in
PEX) to first determine the version and then validate the presentation definition object against that version's specific
rules.

#### Parameters

| name            | type                                                              | description                                                            |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `objToValidate` | <code>PresentationDefinition &#124; PresentationSubmission</code> | the presentation definition or presentation submission to be validated |

#### Return value

The `validate` method returns a validated results array `NonEmptyArray<Checked>` , with structure:

```typescript
interface Checked {
  tag: string;
  status: Status;
  message?: string;
}
```

status can have following values `'info' | 'warn' | 'error'`

### Definition Version Discovery

```typescript
PEX.definitionVersionDiscovery(presentationDefinition);
```

#### Description

A utility function for `PresentationDefinition` objects. This method will determine the version of your
presentationDefinition object.

#### Parameters

|--------------------------|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `presentationDefinition` | <code>PresentationDefinition</code> | the presentation definition that you need to decide the version for |

#### Return value

The `definitionVersionDiscovery` method returns a version or an error, with following structure:

enum PEVersion {
  v1 = 'v1',
  v2 = 'v2',
